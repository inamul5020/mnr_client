echo "üìã Deployment Instructions for Coolify:"
echo "======================================"
echo ""
echo "1. In Coolify Dashboard:"
echo "   - Go to your application settings"
echo "   - Ensure Docker Compose File is set to: docker-compose.coolify-v128.yml"
echo ""
echo "2. Force Fresh Build:"
echo "   - Click 'Rebuild' button"
echo "   - OR delete and recreate the application"
echo ""
echo "3. The fresh builds will be used because:"
echo "   ‚úÖ Frontend dist/ folder is freshly built"
echo "   ‚úÖ Backend dist/ folder is freshly built"
echo "   ‚úÖ Dockerfiles copy from these dist/ folders"
echo ""
echo "4. Verify Deployment:"
echo "   - Check https://client.mnrlk.com loads the latest version"
echo "   - Check https://api.mnrlk.com/health returns OK"
echo "   - Look for the latest changes in the UI"
echo ""
echo "üéØ Key Benefits of This Approach:"
echo "   ‚úÖ Uses pre-built dist/ folders (faster deployment)"
echo "   ‚úÖ No Docker build cache issues"
echo "   ‚úÖ Guaranteed fresh content"
echo "   ‚úÖ Works with existing docker-compose.coolify-v128.yml"
echo ""
echo "‚úÖ Ready to deploy fresh builds to Coolify!"
